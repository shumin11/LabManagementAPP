#  My Personal Project - ***Lab Management***

## Introduction

It is an application helping people working in biology labs to manage their lab supplies.

Normally, for doing experiments in the biology lab, there are many chemicals and machines needed. And people in the lab
are sharing the same lab supplies and machines. This application will help them coordinate with each other, and
to keep track all key details of lab supplies, like **location**, **quantities**, **vendors**, etc. I have worked 
in wet lab over ten years, so I would like to design this application to help researchers in the lab to save time 
looking for chemicals, waiting for supplies to order, and communicating well with people in the same lab.
